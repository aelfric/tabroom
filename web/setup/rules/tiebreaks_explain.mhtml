		<h4>Entering Tiebreakers</h4>

		<p>
			You should set up sets of tiebreakers as they apply to an event or
			set of events in your tournament.  Tiebreakers work on tiers; a
			tier is calculated with all the tiebreakers in that tier and added
			together.  You can also multiply a given tiebreaker with in a tier
			to weight it heavier.  So if you want your speech tournament final
			rankings to count the ranks in the final round twice, with the
			ranks in the other elim rounds once, you would set up a tier with
			ranks for finals with a multiplier of 2, and then put a tiebreaker
			of ranks for elim rounds with a multiplier of 1 into the same tier.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please do not mix tiebreakers that sort in opposite directions in
			the same tier; in other words, lower ranks are better, while higher
			points are better; adding the two together on the same tier will
			generate sheer nonsense and madness.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can set a given tiebreaker to drop the best, worst, or high/low
			values of a given rank.  Next to Drop fill in the type of drop, and
			in the number box, enter how many values deep you want to go (so to
			drop the 2 worst and 2 best speaker points, you'd put 2 in the
			input box and select High/Low in the drop-down)

				<p>
					This determines the competitor's ranking within their
					section or chamber of the rounds of the type specified,
					based on the tiebreakers set for that round.  Thus an
					elim panel's three ballots will be translated into a single
					score ranking; a person who won their quarterfinal overall
					would be given a single rank of 1 for the quarters.
				</p>

				<p>
					So if you wanted the final ranking of an entry to count
					all of ranks given in the final, together with a single
					ranking of how an entry did in their previous elim
					rounds, you should use this tiebreaker.  RecipInRound
					takes the reciprocal of that score.
				</p>

				<p>
					If instead you want to advance equal numbers of competitors
					from each section, you should instead select the option to
					do so at the top of the tiebreaker screen.
