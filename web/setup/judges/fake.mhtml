		<h4>Create Fake Judges for Testing</h4>

		<p>
			Use the below to create a fake tournament judge category.  You should
			create fake entries first if you have not already done so.
		</p>

		<p>
			Using this screen will delete any existing judges in this category.
			It will not create judge prefs (yet) so you should really only test
			it with divisions without prefs.
