		<h5>Adding Sites</h5>

		<p>
			If your tournament is very large and has multiple locations,
			such that rounds/judges/entries would never go from one to
			another, it can be better to schedule them into different
			sites.  That way you can assign rounds and judge pools to two
			different locations, and keep separate room lists.  However, if
			you will have judges going from one "site" to another, put them
			into 1 big site, not multiple sites.
		</p>


		<h5>Online Tournaments</h5>

		<p>

			If you are using <span class="inline semibold bluetext">NSDA Campus</span>
			for an online tournament, <span class="semibold redtext inline"> do not

			create or add sites.</span>  Instead, configure your room needs
			under NSDA Campus at right.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are using Classrooms.cloud or another system involving
			sending links/urls to competitors, you should create a site
			below and mark it as an "Online Site" under Site Settings, to
			allow for sending room URLs to attendees.

		</p>

		<h5>Add an existing site/location</h5>

%		if ($tourn_settings->{"nsda_district"}) {

			<p class="semibold redtext">
				For NSDA Districts, after you create a new site, you must
				assign the site to a weekend/date series to use it; go to
				Setup &gt; Tournament &gt; Dates &amp; Deadlines tab to
				change which weekend is held at which site.
