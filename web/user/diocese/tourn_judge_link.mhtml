				<p class="bigger">
					We're asking for debate judge emails this year
					because we are launching online balloting in
					all debate categories.
				</p>

				<p class="bigger">
					Please advise your judges to bring an Internet
					capable device with them to the tournament, and
					to create a Tabroom.com account by hitting "Sign Up"
					on the top right corner of the main site.  Once
					they have, enter their account email here to link
					them for online ballot access.
				</p>

				<p class="bigger">
					If you don't have their contact they will have
					the opportunity to link their accounts at the
					tournament as well.
				</p>

				<p class="bigger">
					Online balloting is not mandatory but is strongly
					encouraged; it makes for a much easier weekend for
					both the judging and the tournament staff, and
					greatly helps us to stay on time.
