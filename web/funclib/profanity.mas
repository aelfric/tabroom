	The necessity for this file saddens me.  The below is an array of
	individual words or phrases that various people have decided it's a good
	idea to put on ballots or paradigms that are accessed by middle and high
	schoolers, that I therefore now have to collect in one fantastically
	profane source file in order to make filtering & rejecting them in various
	places easier.

	I mean, I swear more than I should, thanks in part to a foul mouthed
	battleaxe of a grandmother whom I love and miss deeply, but not on a ballot
	or paradigm.  Sheesh, come on people.

	This is an off the cuff list compiled directly from various people saying
	things on ballots in contexts they shouldn't.  It's not comprehensive in
	any way because context matters and ultimately tech solutions to social
	problems are suspicious anyway.  So it's not so much censorship or a direct
	opinion about language so much as cutting down on the amount of nonsense I
	have to deal with from people and emails I get about what y'all have done.

	People. That should be a swear word.

	In particular I am not listing the n-bomb here because its use is highly
	context specific, based on who is saying it and why, in a way computers
	cannot judge and I'm not going there.
